# Part 7 – VPC Monitoring with Flow Logs

## Project
NextWork Cloud – AWS Networks (High Track)

## Objective
Set up and analyze **VPC Flow Logs** to monitor network traffic in your Virtual
Private Cloud. Flow Logs help you understand how traffic is moving to, from,
and within your VPC by capturing metadata about allowed and rejected connections.

## What Was Built and Explored

### VPC Flow Logs
- Enabled VPC Flow Logs for one or more VPCs or subnets
- Selected a destination for log storage (CloudWatch Logs or S3)
- Captured metadata for accepted and rejected network traffic

### Monitoring & Analysis
- Viewed Flow Logs to understand traffic patterns
- Identified source and destination IPs for network flows
- Observed how traffic behavior matches expectations based on routing &
  security settings

### Use Cases
- Troubleshooting connectivity issues
- Security analysis and anomaly detection
- Auditing network behavior over time

## Key Concepts
- **VPC Flow Logs:** metadata logs of network traffic
- Traffic filtering and capture settings
- Log destination and retention
- Using logs for troubleshooting and monitoring

## Outcome
After completing this part:
- Flow logs are enabled for the VPC or specific subnets
- You can view network traffic metadata and interpret basic patterns
- You understand how monitoring supports network security and operations

## Next Step
Proceed to **Part 8: Access S3 from a VPC**.
